### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Honore, a frontend developer based in Rwanda.

I build and design cutting-edge digital solutions using JavaScript and Python. I care about the tiniest details when working on a project, working carefully to solve problems. Web design and development allow me to express my creative side and keep myself growing continuously.
